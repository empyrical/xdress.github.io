:description: Our tools just keep getting better and better.  One of the best things
    about Python is its ability to function as a super glue language.  This tutorial 
    will teach participants about how to glue C++ and Python together in a natural
    and easy way.  The first half of this tutorial will be a lecture (with examples)
    on the Cython and xdress tools.  The second half will be a hands-on workshop 
    where the participants and the instructor will jointly work through real world 
    examples.  Participants are encouraged to bring their own codes and problems to 
    the workshop portion.  The participants can dramatically increase the chance of 
    their code base being being examined by emailing the instructor prior to the 
    course.
